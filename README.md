##  Machine Learning Models Used

### 1. **Logistic Regression**
**What it does:**  
Predicts binary outcomes such as yes/no, 0/1, true/false.

**Example Use Case:**  
Will the customer leave the bank? (Churn prediction)

---

### 2. **Decision Tree**
**What it does:**  
Makes decisions by asking simple if-else questions arranged in a tree structure.

**Example Use Case:**  
 If age > 30 → approv product, else → decline.

---

### 3. **Random Forest**
**What it does:**  
Builds many decision trees and combines their predictions for higher accuracy.

**Example Use Case:**  
 Fraud detection, churn prediction, credit scoring.

---

### 4. **XGBoost / LightGBM**
**What they do:**  
Boosting models that build trees sequentially while correcting previous errors. Extremely powerful for structured data.

**Example Use Case:**  
 Popular in 90% of winning Kaggle solutions.

---

### 5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
**What it does:**  
Finds the best boundary that separates different classes.

**Example Use Case:**  
 Classifying emails as spam or not spam.

---

### 6. **K-Means Clustering**
**What it does:**  
Groups similar customers/items into clusters without using labels.

**Example Use Case:**  
 Customer segmentation for marketing campaigns.

---

### 7. **Naive Bayes**
**What it does:**  
Uses probability to classify text.

**Example Use Case:**  
 Spam detection, customer reviews sentiment analysis.

---

### 8. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
**What they do:**  
Brain-inspired models used for complex learning tasks.

**Example Use Case:**  
 Predicting loan defaults or customer churn.

---

### 9. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
**What they do:**  
Excellent for image-related tasks.

**Example Use Case:**  
 Cheque image verification, ID document scanning.

---

### 10. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
**What it does:**  
Designed for sequence and time-series data.

**Example Use Case:**  
 Predicting bank stock trends, customer transaction patterns.
